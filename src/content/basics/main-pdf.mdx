Experienced backend developer with a passion for crafting seamless software solutions. Skilled in Java, Spring, Python, AWS, and SQL. My journey began in systems integration, and I've fallen in love with backend development since. With a background in technical support and administration, I create software that serves end-users, developers, and contributors alike.
