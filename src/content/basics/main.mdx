I entered the world of programming through systems integration and fell in love with backend development. My journey with Java, thanks to the Talend tool, was a pivotal moment. Currently, as an experienced backend developer, I specialize in creating APIs in Java and Spring.

My skillset also encompasses Python, AWS, SQL, and CI/CD processes that ensure the smoothness of software development. My passion is focused on refining backend skills and acquiring competencies in the DevOps domain, enabling me to combine software development with deployment and maintenance practices.

Having also worked in the past as technical support and administrator roles, I possess a unique ability to create software that caters to all – whether they are end-users, developers, or contributors supporting software from various angles.
