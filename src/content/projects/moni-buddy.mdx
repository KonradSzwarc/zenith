This personal project is a web application designed to help users manage their budgets by tracking income and expenses, setting financial goals, and visualizing spending habits. As the sole developer, I designed and implemented the entire application using React and TypeScript. I utilized Firebase for authentication, database, and hosting services, ensuring secure and efficient data management. The user interface was built with Material-UI, providing a responsive and user-friendly design. I integrated interactive charts to visualize spending patterns and developed a feature for generating detailed financial reports. This project is ongoing, and I continuously add new features and improvements based on user feedback.
