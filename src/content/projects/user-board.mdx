This project involved developing a real-time data visualization dashboard for monitoring and analyzing user engagement metrics. My role as the Lead Frontend Developer included architecting the application using React, integrating D3.js for creating interactive charts, and implementing server-side rendering with Next.js to optimize performance. I coordinated closely with the back-end team to define efficient data fetching strategies using React Query, ensuring seamless synchronization of real-time data. Additionally, I mentored junior developers on the team, conducted code reviews, and established coding standards to maintain high code quality.
